# ssh-jarvis

SSH into Iron Man's suit. JARVIS responds via Claude.

```
ssh operator@localhost -p 2222
```

## Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy .env.example to .env and add your Anthropic API key
cp .env.example .env

# Build and run
npm run dev
```

## Usage

Connect with any SSH client:

```bash
ssh operator@localhost -p 2222
# Password: jarvis
```

Then just explore:

```
ls
cd weapons
cat repulsor/calibration.ts
grep -r "TODO" /
git log --oneline
ps aux
```

The filesystem is generated by Claude. Every file contains real,
working TypeScript. The suit has history. Not everything is explained.

## Config

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | — | Your Anthropic API key |
| `SSH_PORT` | `2222` | Port to listen on |
| `SSH_PASSWORD` | `jarvis` | SSH password |

## How it works

1. `ssh2` handles all SSH protocol and crypto
2. User input is sent to Claude's API with a JARVIS system prompt
3. Claude generates terminal output and streams it back
4. Each SSH session maintains its own conversation history
